Question

In a gaming application, each warrior is walking using a walking stick. Monsters can steal these walking sticks. A warrior becomes immobile if he loses the stick. A warrior has a name and age. A monster also has a name and age.

Add the required methods to these classes.

In addition to the classes you identified above, you should have a separate class ‘MyGame’ that contains the main method. Inside the main method, create two warrior objects, and a monster object. Now set the first warrior’s age to the monster’s age. Now write the code for the monster to steal the walking stick of the second warrior.
